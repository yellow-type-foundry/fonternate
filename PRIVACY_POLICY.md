# Privacy Policy for Fonternate

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Introduction

Fonternate ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Data Collection

**Fonternate does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

### What We Don't Collect
- We do not collect personal information
- We do not track your browsing history
- We do not collect website content or data
- We do not transmit any data to external servers
- We do not use analytics or tracking services

### What We Store Locally
The extension only stores your font preferences locally on your device using Chrome's local storage (`chrome.storage.sync`). This includes:
- Your selected font name
- Font weight preferences
- Typography settings (text transform, stylistic sets, etc.)
- OpenType feature preferences

This data is stored entirely on your device and is never transmitted to us or any third party.

## How We Use Your Data

Since we don't collect any data, there's nothing to use. All preferences are stored locally on your device for your convenience.

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or transmit any data because we don't collect any.

## Permissions

Fonternate requires the following permissions:

- **activeTab**: To apply font changes to the current tab
- **storage**: To save your font preferences locally on your device
- **host_permissions** (`<all_urls>`): To inject font styles into web pages you visit

These permissions are necessary for the extension to function. We do not use them to collect or transmit any data.

## Third-Party Services

Fonternate does not integrate with any third-party services or APIs.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any personal data, there's no data to access, modify, or delete. Your preferences stored locally can be cleared at any time by:
1. Uninstalling the extension
2. Clearing Chrome's extension storage
3. Using the extension's reset functionality

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.

## Contact Us

## Compliance

This extension complies with:
- Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

Since we don't collect any personal data, there are no compliance concerns regarding data collection, storage, or processing.
